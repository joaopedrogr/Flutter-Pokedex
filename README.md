# Pokedex

## ðŸš€ About the Project
The Pokedex Flutter is a web application built using the Flutter framework that displays a list of PokÃ©mon with detailed information about each one. It consumes a public REST API (PokÃ©API) and integrates with Firebase for backend features. Although the project was built using Flutter, only the web version is available in the repository due to deployment limitations.

Key Features:
- Dynamic PokÃ©mon List: Fetches and displays PokÃ©mon dynamically from the PokÃ©API.
- PokÃ©mon Details Page: View detailed information about a selected PokÃ©mon, including types, stats, height, and weight.
- Responsive Design: Fully optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- API Integration: Fetches real-time data from the PokÃ©API.
- Firebase Integration: Uses Firebase for authentication and/or data handling (depending on the configured features).

The Pokedex Flutter project is a great opportunity to learn Flutter fundamentals, API integration, and Firebase usage in a real-world scenario.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
- API Integration: The app integrates with the PokÃ©API to fetch PokÃ©mon data dynamically. For example:
```
Future<void> fetchPokemonList() async {
  final response = await http.get(Uri.parse("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=50"));
  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    final data = json.decode(response.body);
    setState(() {
      pokemonList = data['results'];
    });
  }
}
```
- Firebase Integration: The app uses Firebase for authentication or backend features, for example:
```
Future<void> loginUser(String email, String password) async {
  try {
    UserCredential user = await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithEmailAndPassword(
      email: email,
      password: password,
    );
    print("User logged in: ${user.user?.email}");
  } catch (e) {
    print("Login error: $e");
  }
}

```
- State Management: Uses setState, optionally Provider, for managing the UI state.
- Componentization: Uses reusable widgets such as PokemonCard, DetailScreen, and TypeBadge.
- Responsive Design: Layouts adapt to different screen sizes using Flutterâ€™s responsive layout techniques.
- Performance Optimization: Uses caching, efficient network calls, and Flutterâ€™s build optimization techniques.
